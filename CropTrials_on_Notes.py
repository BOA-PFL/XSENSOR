This code crops the XSENSOR data based on the Notes column. The data will be
cropped into smaller trials based on the notes and saved in a different folder

This code searches the existing cropped trial based on the subject name and
configuration. If the current subject/configuration exists in the "saved"
this code skips cropping the file
